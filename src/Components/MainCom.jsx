                        {activeSkill === "HTML" && <p>I use HTML to create the basic structure of websites. With HTML, I write different parts of a page like titles, paragraphs, pictures, and links. This helps to organize the content clearly so visitors can understand and use the website easily. Learning HTML is very important because it is the main language that all websites use. It works together with CSS and JavaScript to make websites look good and work well on different devices.</p>}
                        {activeSkill === "CSS" && <p>I use CSS to add styles and colors to my websites. CSS helps me change how the page looks by setting fonts, colors, sizes, and layouts.

Learning CSS is important because it makes websites more attractive and easier to use.</p>}
                        {activeSkill === "JS" && <p>I use JavaScript (JS) to write scripts that make websites interactive. With JavaScript, I can add things like buttons that work when you click them, forms that check your answers, and animations that make the page more lively. JavaScript helps websites respond to users and change content without needing to reload the whole page. Learning JavaScript is important because it makes websites smarter and more fun to use.</p>}
                        {activeSkill === "React.js" && <p>I use React and Vite because they are very helpful tools for building websites. React is a popular JavaScript library that helps me create web pages by breaking them into smaller parts called components, which makes coding easier and faster. Vite is a tool that helps me start and build my projects quickly with modern features. Together, React and Vite make it simple to create fast, organized, and modern websites.</p>}
